iff.js
======
A decoder for the IFF/ILBM file format in Javascript.

Sorry I haven't had time to write any documentation yet, you know how it is. A working example is included, which should be enough to get you going.

NB: you might want to check out Bobseb/ilbm.js instead - it seems more complete than my version (supports HAM, EHB, etc.). iff.js seems faster though.
